# REINFORCE

My implementation of the REINFORCE algorithm for the cartpole problem. The problem consists of making a machine learn to balance a stick on a platform as shown in the image. In my implementation I use a basic Neural Network as the learning algorithm.

REINFORCE belongs to a class of algorithms called Policy Gradient algorithms. These algorithms implement a policy. A policy is a model that takes the state of the environment as an input and generates probabilities of actions as output. The action with the biggest probability is executed, in hopes to perform well on a given task.
